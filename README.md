# Line Following Robot

This line-following mapping robot concept is designed to autonomously navigate a predefined path by following a visible line or series of coordinates. 
The robot uses an infrared sensor array to detect the line. IMU and optical flow sensor are used to give precise position and heading.
This can be combined to follow a path and adjusts its movement accordingly. Since this is only a concept idea, the CAD model is not provided.
